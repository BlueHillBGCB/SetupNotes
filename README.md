Notes on setting up systems in Educational Environments

Michael McMahon

Chrome notes will demonstrate the settings and extension I use.

iPad & iPod notes will show how to add only the apps you want for your program area and prevent children from browsing inappropriate materials and adding their own apps.

MacOSXTerminal has many of my favorite commands for the Mac Terminal.  With Terminal, you can use the Unix system that is runs the system.  The drawback is an extremely lower number of available applications than FreeBSD or GNU/Linux.

More to come!
